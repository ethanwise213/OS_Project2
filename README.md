# CPU Scheduling Simulation: SRTF and HRRN

This project simulates two classic CPU scheduling algorithms:
- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** (preemptive)
- **Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)** (non-preemptive)

It demonstrates how each algorithm schedules processes based on arrival and burst times, and compares their performance metrics such as average waiting time, average turnaround time, CPU utilization, and throughput.

## Features
- Simulates SRTF and HRRN scheduling
- Calculates waiting time and turnaround time for each process
- Computes and displays average statistics
- 100% CPU utilization and throughput measurement
- Simple, modular design for easy extension
